# Experimental Vegan

exp-vegan is a project to create recipes in an open-source way, using github. 

## The idea:

Open source recipes to contribute to the large archive of vegan recipes that exist. The term 'experimental' here is to indicate
a degree of risk-taking in cooking, to try new ideas and, most importantly, to refine recipes over time through communal effort.

## To contribute:

Please visit the recipe source markdown files, or add a new one! If you add a new recipe, please add the following frontmatter to the top of your md file:
```

```

You can use prose.io if you want.
